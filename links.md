# LINKS
## Week 01

1. [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

    Markdown is generally a good to have tool that people use for multiple reasons. It makes writing so much easier by providing support for mathematical writing syntax like $\text{Latex}$ and gives the user flexibility towards how they wish to format their writing. Not to mention the ability to write bits and pieces of code from multiple languages with their own syntax highlighting.

    This cheatsheet is comprehensive enough for beginner users to learn the basics of formatting in markdown. One downside to this is that it does not discuss about mathematical syntaxes, which is understandable since they are usually in the form of $\text{Latex}$.

2. [Basic Regex in 15 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgBWp9EIlMM)

    This video gave me a pretty good understanding on how regex works (simple ones at least).<br>
    It also introduced me to [this](https://www.debuggex.com/) tool which visualizes the written regex syntax.

3. [How to Use Square Brackets in Bash Part I](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/using-square-brackets-bash-part-1/) and [Part II](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/using-square-brackets-bash-part-2/)
    
    This article discusses about `[]` in Bash which they explained really well in my opinion. It mentions about what are the uses for the square brackets and also some examples of why you might want to use them.

    That site in general is a great site to visit, cause it does not only talk about square brackets, but also about numerous topics such as [`{}`](https://www.linux.com/topic/desktop/all-about-curly-braces-bash/) and more.

## Week 02
1. [Grep for Text Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGgTmxXp7xQ)

    Grep was a pretty daunting thing for me to understand since I'm a beginner at bash related commands. The video linked helped me a ton to understand the options that `grep` provides, and how it could be used in general.

2. [PGP for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-MPcUHhXoc)

    This video delivers on simplicity in my opinion. It demonstrates what `PGP` is, and how it works with examples. Not to mention how concise it is with such easy to understand explanation.

3. [AWK Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YOZmI-zWok&t=985s)

    This video provides explanation on `awk` commands and with pretty good and straightforward explanation. Highly recommended for beginners in my personal opinion.

## Week 03
1. [What does this line mean?](https://explainshell.com/)
    
    As a student learning command lines related things, you might sometimes encounter a certain command line that you just have no clue what that command line is about. Fear not since you have this site that explains what that gibberish means.

2. [What is SED?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACe7aiGczw)

    I've linked this youtube channel before, but I can't deny that I really like how he explains the topics. It provides multiple use cases of SED and the explanation is easy to understand since he pairs it up with examples.

3. [VIM: Oh wait what just happened](https://www.keycdn.com/blog/vim-commands)

    You might see some 'gods' just type things in VIM like it's no big deal with amazing speed and accuracy. Then you think to yourself, what did he just press to enable what just happened. Well this link is a perfect resource for you, since it explains a lot of VIM commands that I just can't seem to find for a long time.

## Week 04
1. [Files & File Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN8YgJnShPM)

    It's made by CrashCourse, which I've liked for a long time. They explain things very well, especially with graphics included. It's really easy to understand. Highly recommended.

2. [How Does It Manage It's Memory ?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdkxXygc3rE)

    A brief explanation into how memory is managed in computers. Personally I am a visual learner guy, so in my opinion, graphics are a tremendous help. This video did just that, and did it well and simple enough for me to understand. It's also not that long of a video which is helpful for me since longer videos does not really work with me.

3. [Printf Prints What???](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string#:~:text=%22printf%22%20is%20the%20name%20of,parsing)

    It is wikipedia, which is quite weird in some articles, but not on others. This particular page discusses about the format specifiers that printf accepts. That's why I use wikipedia cause I expect it to have a pretty complete list. One drawback of this site is that it does not come with examples which would've been especially helpful.

## Week 05
1. [Virtual Memory Explained (Not Gary Explains)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lFnKYCZT5o)

    Yes, it is pretty lengthy, but well worth it. Computerphile never disappoints in bringing out good quality educational content as always. This video gives a clear understanding to how virtual memory works, how it resides in the memory management side of things in a computer. Highly recommended

2. [Paged? Segmented? Huh?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9yZNLeOj4s)

    Great video to learn about the difference between the two common types of memory management, which is paged and also segmented. It also gives a brief explanation of virtual memory as well if you want to check it out. It's not that long of a video and a 7 minute worth well spent.

3. [Pointers and Dynamic Memory (Stack vs Heap)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8-ht2AKyH4)

    Another long video ~17mins. Gives a great explanation of memory by comparing it side by side with a C++ program. It describes how variables are allocated in the memory whether it's the heap or stack. The video also provides an explanation of how each variables are referenced by pointers and much more.
