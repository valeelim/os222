## Week 01

1. [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

    Markdown is generally a good to have tool that people use for multiple reasons. It makes writing so much easier by providing support for mathematical writing syntax like $\text{Latex}$ and gives the user flexibility towards how they wish to format their writing. Not to mention the ability to write bits and pieces of code from multiple languages with their own syntax highlighting.

    This cheatsheet is comprehensive enough for beginner users to learn the basics of formatting in markdown. One downside to this is that it does not discuss about mathematical syntaxes, which is understandable since they are usually in the form of $\text{Latex}$.

2. [Basic Regex in 15 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgBWp9EIlMM)

    This video gave me a pretty good understanding on how regex works (simple ones at least).<br>
    It also introduced me to [this](https://www.debuggex.com/) tool which visualizes the written regex syntax.

3. [How to Use Square Brackets in Bash Part I](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/using-square-brackets-bash-part-1/) and [Part II](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/using-square-brackets-bash-part-2/)
    
    This article discusses about `[]` in Bash which they explained really well in my opinion. It mentions about what are the uses for the square brackets and also some examples of why you might want to use them.

    That site in general is a great site to visit, cause it does not only talk about square brackets, but also about numerous topics such as [`{}`](https://www.linux.com/topic/desktop/all-about-curly-braces-bash/) and more.

## Week 02
1. [Grep for Text Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGgTmxXp7xQ)

    Grep was a pretty daunting thing for me to understand since I'm a beginner at bash related commands. The video linked helped me a ton to understand the options that `grep` provides, and how it could be used in general.

2. [PGP for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-MPcUHhXoc)

    This video delivers on simplicity in my opinion. It demonstrates what `PGP` is, and how it works with examples. Not to mention how concise it is with such easy to understand explanation.

3. [AWK Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YOZmI-zWok&t=985s)

    This video provides explanation on `awk` commands and with pretty good and straightforward explanation. Highly recommended for beginners in my personal opinion.
